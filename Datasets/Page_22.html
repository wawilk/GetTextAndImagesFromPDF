Ensure the inert gaseous medium used in the refrigerated-area sprinkler system is compatible with all sprinkler system components.</p><br><p>2.2.5.4.2 The use of air as a gaseous medium for maintaining internal pressure within a refrigerated-area sprinkler system is an acceptable alternative to an inert gaseous medium when an adequately sized FM Approved dry air unit system for a refrigerated-area sprinkler system is provided. Arrange the air intake for compressed air as follows:</p><br><p>A. The air is taken from the protected area, or</p><br><p>B. The air can be taken from room temperature air when the dry air unit system has been tested with air intake at room temperature and the pressure dew point can be maintained 20ºF (11ºC) lower than the ambient temperature of the protected area.</p><br><p>2.2.5.4.3 The use of air as a gaseous medium for maintaining internal pressure within a refrigerated-area sprinkler system is an acceptable alternative to an inert gaseous medium when an adequately sized dehydrator or regenerative air dryer is provided on the air supply line to the sprinkler system as demonstrated in Figure 2.2.5.4.3. Ensure the following:</p><br><p>A. The air intake line from the protected area to the air compressor and tank is in accordance with the equation shown in Figure 2.2.5.4.3, and</p><br><p>B. The dry air feed to the sprinkler system is connected to the sprinkler's feed main in the protected area through separate duplex lines that can be easily removed for inspection and removal of any ice accumulations, and</p><br><p>C. The duplex lines are arranged so that the diameter of each line provides a minimum exposed exterior surface area of 0.7 ft2/scfm (0.038 m2/(m3/h)), and</p><br><p>D. The minimum length of each duplex line is at least 30 times the line's nominal diameter, and</p><br><p>E. The dry air feed line connects to the sprinkler system's feed main via a return bend equipped with a check valve.</p><br><p>Return Bend</p><br><p>8</p><br><p>To Sprinklers</p><br><p>Heated Area</p><br><p>Protected Area</p><br><p>Air Dryer</p><br><p>Pressure Regulator</p><br><p>Each Air Supply Line min. 30 times nominal diameter size</p><br><p>Air Compressor and Tank</p><br><p>Freezer Area Intake</p><br><p>L = (15)(D) + (120)/(D), when D is in inches L = (15)(D) + (77,420(/(D), when D is in mm</p><br>Fig. 2.2.5.4.3.
