The use of K11.2 (K160) sprinklers having nominal 1/2 in. (15 mm) npt threaded connections is acceptable only if they are being considered as a retrofit option for the replacement of existing K8.0 (K115) or smaller sprinklers.</p><br><h2>2.5.4.1.2 Determining Acceptable RTI Ratings for Storage Sprinklers</h2><br><p>2.5.4.1.2.1 The installation of standard-response Storage sprinklers is acceptable for both wet-type and dry-type sprinkler systems.</p><br><p>2.5.4.1.2.2 The installation of quick-response Storage sprinklers is acceptable wet type sprinkler systems; however, do not use quick-response sprinklers for the following types of storage occupancies:</p><br><p>A. Spray applications of ignitable liquids</p><br><p>B. Hydraulic equipment using ignitable liquids</p><br><p>C. Occupancies involving ignitable liquids other than those incidental to a process and are in safety containers having volume capacities of 5 gal (19 L) or less</p><br><p>D. Vehicle assembly or repair areas where there is fuel in fuel tanks</p><br><p>E. Occupancies where there are large areas shielded from sprinkler discharge</p><br><p>F. Areas where oil, dust, lint, or similar combustible residues can accumulate on ceilings and/or building structural support members</p><br><p>G. Where the occupancy-specific data sheet does not recommend their use for the occupancy being protected</p><br><h2>2.5.4.2 Determining Obstructed or Unobstructed Ceiling Construction</h2><br><p>2.5.4.2.1 See the flowchart in Figure 2.5.4.2.1 to determine if the ceiling construction qualifies as either unobstructed or obstructed for the installation of Storage sprinklers. Note that a solid ceiling structural member is one where its cross-sectional area in a vertical plane is less than 70% open.</p><br>@2021-2023 Factory Mutual Insurance Company. All rights reserved.
